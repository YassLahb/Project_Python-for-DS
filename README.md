# Project_Python-for-DS
Project of Python for Data Science and Analysis. Online shoppers Intention.

# Main goal of the project : 
The main goal of this project is to analyze the dataset and visualize it so that we are able to see the main features that we need through using multiple libraries(matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh...) and do some modelling to design a machine learning classification system, that is able to predict an online shopper's intention(buy or no buy), based on the values of the given features and using libraries like scikit-learn through using multiple algorithms and comparing between them. Finally, we will transform the model into a Django API so that it can be displayed properly through it.
